<h2>1. Imports data</h2>
```
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

<h2>2. Create a Seaborn pairplot</h2>

```
#all quantitative features of the data set
penguins_graph=penguins[['Species',"Culmen Length (mm)","Culmen Depth (mm)","Sex","Island","Body Mass (g)","Delta 15 N (o/oo)","Flipper Length (mm)"]]
#plot by species
sns.pairplot(penguins_graph, hue = 'Species')
```

**Analysis:** From above pairplots, we can find significant clusters and correlation between the variables. Distinct clusters where the 3 colors are more seperate represent plots where the 2 variables significantly correlate with the species of a penguin. Plots where there are not really any distinct clusters represent variables that to not interact in a way that helps distinguish the species of the penguin. We used this graph to identiffy the plots where all 3 colors in the plot were more distinct and seperate. We then kept note of these variables to use for later visualizations and modeling. (ex: culmen length and culmen depth, body mass and culmen length, delta 15 N and culmen length, and flipper length and culmen length).
